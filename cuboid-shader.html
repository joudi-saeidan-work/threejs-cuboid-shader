        //the PerspectiveCamera function in Three.js is used to create a camera that determines what part of the scene will be visible in the screen.
        // 1. field of view: This determines how much of the scene will be visible through the camera.
        //2. aspect ratio:It helps adjust the view so it looks correct on different screens.
        //3. near: how close the objects can be to the camera before they disappear from the view.
        //4. far: This is how far the objects can be from the camera before they disappear from the view.

        // What happens when you increase or decrease the numerical values?
        //Adjusting the values of the four arguments in the PerspectiveCamera function can change the view and perspective of the scene on the screen. Increasing or decreasing the field of view value changes how much of the scene is visible. Adjusting the aspect ratio value changes the scene's appearance. Changing the near and far values affects how close or far objects can be before disappearing from the view.
